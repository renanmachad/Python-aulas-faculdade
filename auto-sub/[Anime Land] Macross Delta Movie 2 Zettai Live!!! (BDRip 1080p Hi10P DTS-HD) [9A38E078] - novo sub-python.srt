Macross Frontier: Labyrinth of Time

2
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,751
<i>It's been over half a century since
humanity began its journey across the stars.</i>

3
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:50,800
<i>During that time, we have come into contact
with many alien races, including some</i>

4
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:54,178
<i>descendants of the long lost interstellar
civilization known as the Protoculture.</i>

5
00:00:55,096 --> 00:01:00,184
<i>Many tears have been shed because
of this, both in grief and in joy.</i>

6
00:01:10,152 --> 00:01:13,364
Hey everybody!
You all having a good time?!

7
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:22,748
I'm sorry to say this, but...
this next song will be the last one.

8
00:01:22,873 --> 00:01:26,961
- Aw! We want more!
- Aw! We want more!

9
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:32,758
This song is for those I hold dear.

10
00:01:35,344 --> 00:01:36,554
I hope you like it.

11
00:01:38,347 --> 00:01:43,227
<i>Without a doubt these feelings are within me</i>

12
00:01:43,352 --> 00:01:49,317
<i>Unable to be contained, they overflow</i>

13
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:59,327
<i>When I think of you, my
bosom becomes the universe,</i>

14
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:03,331
<i>holding the stars close</i>

15
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:05,541
<i>Our days are limited</i>

16
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:09,086
<i>Our days are limited
It's been some time
since that‘ fateful day.</i>

17
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:10,338
<i>Our days are limited</i>

18
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:10,880
<i>I've decided to spend them loving you</i>

19
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,049
<i>I've decided to spend them loving you
To put an end to that tragic war,</i>

20
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:13,341
<i>I've decided to spend them loving you</i>

21
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,426
<i>I've decided to spend them loving you
Sheryl burned what was left of her life
with a song that moved the galaxy.</i>

22
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,510
<i>Sheryl burned what was left of her life
with a song that moved the galaxy.</i>

23
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,137
<i>I'm starting to find the strength
Sheryl burned what was left of her life
with a song that moved the galaxy.</i>

24
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:18,929
<i>I'm starting to find the strength</i>

25
00:02:18,929 --> 00:02:20,681
<i>I'm starting to find the strength
To this day, she still sleeps.</i>

26
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:22,141
<i>I'm starting to find the strength</i>

27
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:26,979
<i>to say I love you</i>

28
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:31,317
<i>It's a long road</i>

29
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:41,702
<i>Guided by the light
shining in the distance</i>

30
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:47,708
<i>Let us always meet again</i>

31
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,004
Ranka?

32
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:55,591
<i>...abIe to meet now</i>

33
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,220
<i>This feeling that grows ever deep,</i>

34
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,429
<i>This fee//ng that grows ever deep,
Huh?! Fold Waves?!</i>

35
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:00,554
Huh?! Fold Waves?!

00:03:00,554 --> 00:03:01,305
/ vow to <i>keep</i>
Huh?! Fold Waves?!

37
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:01,639
<i>I vow to keep</i>

38
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,348
/ vow to <i>keep</i>
- Shush!
- Shush!

39
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:03,557
<i>I vow to keep</i>

40
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,894
<i>May it never waver</i>

41
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:15,611
<i>amidst the freezing wind</i>

42
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,662
The Galactic Heritage Bureau has
given clearance for us to investigate.

43
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,248
Thanks for always
helping out, everyone.

44
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:31,836
Checking out lost technology is also
the job of Super Dimensional Tour escorts.

45
00:03:32,461 --> 00:03:35,089
Plus we get to go to your concerts.

46
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:40,261
This place is really amazing though.

47
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,891
The Well of Souls is a temple left behind
by the descendants of the Protoculture.

48
00:03:47,309 --> 00:03:48,728
The Well of Souls...

49
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:51,021
A place to commune with the gods.

50
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:54,942
Legend says it was used to
converse with the dead as well.

51
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,778
Please make this quick, Ranka.

52
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,823
You still have new song lyrics to finish.

53
00:04:00,948 --> 00:04:03,826
And we leave for your
next tour stop tomorrow.

54
00:04:06,245 --> 00:04:08,289
Sorry for worrying you...

55
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,292
But I feel that I might
reach him this time.

56
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:17,631
Here you go. Taiyaki and
tuna buns, your favorites.

57
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:21,719
This setup looks like a
gravesite every time.

58
00:04:21,969 --> 00:04:23,888
Hey! Don't say that.

59
00:04:24,513 --> 00:04:29,310
That's right. Alto promised
he'd come back alive, so there.

60
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:34,398
What was that?

61
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:37,359
Fold Waves!

62
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:40,821
Just as I thought. It must have
reactivated in response to

63
00:04:40,946 --> 00:04:43,324
Ranka's voice during last night's concert.

64
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,703
It's calling me...

65
00:04:48,078 --> 00:04:48,704
Huh?

66
00:04:51,832 --> 00:04:53,876
It's Alto who's calling!

67
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,920
Wait! It's too dangerous!

68
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:03,928
<i>This is the mysterious Labyrinth of Time,</i>

69
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,013

<i>Empty answers dance all around me</i>

74
00:05:13,562 --> 00:05:16,607
<i>Even if it's just a dream, I don't care</i>

75
00:05:16,732 --> 00:05:19,068
<i>If it means I can change the past,</i>

76
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:24,406
<i>I'd become the Devil himself</i>

78
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,603

00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,482
I wish both Roid and Keith

339
00:22:39,607 --> 00:22:42,360
were here to feel this wind.

340
00:22:52,912 --> 00:22:55,123
Whew... Huh?

341
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:01,087
Freyja?

342
00:23:04,757 --> 00:23:06,426
These houses are delightful.

343
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,303
They're so cute!

344
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,804
So serene. So excited.

345
00:23:10,346 --> 00:23:12,765
Yeah. It's really nice, Freyja...

346
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,603
Hey, what's wrong?

347
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:20,607
Freyja ran off, bailed on her engagement.

348
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:22,442
Rei-Rei!

349
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:25,737
Freyja!

350
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,828
Mister Mayor!

351
00:23:33,953 --> 00:23:38,499
I'm really, really...
I'm so totally sorry!

352
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:46,466
It's a relief to see you're okay, Freyja.

353
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,467
Huh?

354
00:23:52,847 --> 00:23:55,183
Thank you for taking care of Freyja.

355
00:23:55,308 --> 00:24:00,772
On behalf of the people of
Ravengrass Village, I bow my rune.

356
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,523
Mister Mayor.

357
00:24:02,982 --> 00:24:05,318
No, it was Freyja's voice

358
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:10,156
that bridged the gap between
Windermere and ourselves.

359
00:24:14,243 --> 00:24:15,787
- Freyja!
- Freyja!

360
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:16,913
Welcome back!

361
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,749
- It's been so long.
- Rune Pika!

362
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:37,183
Alright guys, wait your turn.

363
00:24:39,018 --> 00:24:41,187
M-Muah! Here you go!

364
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,940
Gori-Gori cute!

365
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,243
Ten win streak!

366
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,870
Heh, weak and feeble.

367
00:24:59,914 --> 00:25:02,166
I'm a woman without mercy.

368
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:07,755
You've performed with Ranka Lee,
the Super Dimensional Cinderella?!

369
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,676
Ah, yes. I used to be a solo idol, so...

370
00:25:12,051 --> 00:25:13,886
I wouldn't say you "performed with" her.

371
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,305
It was a variety show where
she watched a video of you

372
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:19,017
rodeo riding a Galactic Hippo
during a studio taping, that's all.

373
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,601
G-Galactic Hippo?

374
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:24,480
Hmm, was that what it was?
I can't really recall... Huh?!

375
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,776
- Wow.
- Kaname, embarrassing past.

376
00:25:28,901 --> 00:25:30,194
Cut it out!

377
00:25:31,612 --> 00:25:34,615
Sparkling apple cider? No thanks.

378
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:36,826
Why not? It's tasty.

379
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:38,703
All she's been drinking is apple milk.

380
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,913
I know! She can't handle the fizzles.

381
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,790
What a baby!

382
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:04,145
I gotta say, our village's
apples are Gori-Gori great!

383
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,313
Right, Hayate?

384
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,440
Yeah, Gori-Gori for sure.

385
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,197
Wait, are you
Freyja's boyfriend?!

386
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,115
Really? But isn't he an Earthling?

387
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,825
<i>W-Wham?</i>

388
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,828
No, me and Hayate aren't like that...!

389
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,458
So what's an Earthling's wind taste like?

390
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:29,212
Wife's been talking about wanting kids.

391
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,422
Well, the sooner the better.

392
00:26:31,547 --> 00:26:34,217
Then it's on to the second and third one.

393
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,179
What is it?

394
00:26:38,304 --> 00:26:39,806
Oh, it's just...

395
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,351
Everyone here really is so young...

396
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:47,188
The average lifespan of a
Windermerian is 30 years.

397
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:48,773
Around these parts,

398
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:53,236
a child plants their own
sapling at the age of five.

399
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:57,240
Remember, the people of this planet
are very different from us.

400
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,078
Mister Mayor.

401
00:27:03,162 --> 00:27:04,831
Thank you sir,

402
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,959
for welcoming Freyja home like this.

403
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:13,172
- Likewise, seeing Freyja so happ-
- Defection is a capital offense.

404
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,509
Be thankful for His Majesty Heinz's mercy.

405
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,262
Yes, I fully understand.

406
00:27:22,056 --> 00:27:25,226
Why'r_e you bringing that up?
Freyja sang to bring peace!

407
00:27:25,351 --> 00:27:27,145
You have no say in this, outsider.

408
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,229
What did you say?!

409
00:27:28,354 --> 00:27:30,273
Hey, what's with you guys?!

410
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:31,357
Back off!

411
00:27:31,482 --> 00:27:32,900
Stop this nonsense!

412
00:27:33,025 --> 00:27:33,943
Party's over!

413
00:27:39,365 --> 00:27:41,826
What use is talking to
aliens at this point?!

414
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,870
We should be running them out!

415
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,041
By order of His Majesty,
I'm tasked to protect you.

416
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,211
Even though I completely
agree with those men.

417
00:27:52,336 --> 00:27:55,381
- What?!
- Hold it. Let him handle this.

418
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,682
You're disturbing the peace.

419
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:07,518
Sir Knight!

420
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,312
To hell with Walkijlre!

421
00:28:09,645 --> 00:28:12,565
They're spewing their
filthy songs in our wind!

422
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,031
Like it or not, they are
His Majesty's guests.

423
00:28:24,535 --> 00:28:26,829
Do you mean to oppose your king?

424
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,664
Just a moment please.

425
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,547
- Father Johann?
- Father Johann!

426
00:28:36,672 --> 00:28:37,840
Father Johann!

427
00:28:37,965 --> 00:28:39,383
Father Johann?

428
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,427
Johann Winly.

429
00:28:41,969 --> 00:28:45,389
One of the priests who
serve the God of the Wind.

430
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,615
Please, could you possibly forgive
these men for their offense?

431
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,742
Father Johann...

432
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,457
As you wish.

433
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:13,918
You have my thanks.

434
00:29:15,002 --> 00:29:17,421
You three should leave for now.

435
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:20,258
W-We Will.

436
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:27,515
Thank you, Father Johann.

437
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:30,768
I hope you will forgive my intrusion.

438
00:29:30,893 --> 00:29:33,312
No, you really saved us.

439
00:29:41,487 --> 00:29:45,700
So you are Mikumo Guynemer,
Singer of the Stars.

440
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:49,704
lam Mikumo Guynemer of WaIkUre,

441
00:29:49,829 --> 00:29:51,789
nothing more.

442
00:29:52,331 --> 00:29:55,418
Yes, of course. Do forgive me.

443
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,172
Freyja Wion.

444
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:03,467
Yesterday was the first time
I've heard you sing in a while.

445
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:09,307
<i>I remember being welcomed by your
songs every time I visited this village.</i>

446
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:20,568
I hope you continue to add
your fine voice to the wind.

447
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:23,029
Y-You betcha!

448
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:26,365
Freyja! Where are your manners?
That's no way to talk to Father Johann!

449
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:27,575
Oh!

450
00:30:40,212 --> 00:30:44,342
Oh, I missed the color of the wind here.

451
00:30:47,094 --> 00:30:51,724
By the end of Spring, this place will
be blooming with apple blossoms.

452
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:56,145
Little white flowers everywhere!

453
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,439
I'd really like to show you, Hayate.

454
00:30:58,564 --> 00:31:01,067
Yeah, I'd like to see it someday.

455
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:03,861
Where did you get an old
picture like that anyway?
That's so cute. The two of
them off alone in the orchard.

456
00:31:03,861 --> 00:31:03,986
That's so cute. The two of
them off alone in the orchard.

457
00:31:03,986 --> 00:31:04,487
I am a woman without limits.
That's so cute. The two of
them off alone in the orchard.

458
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,196
I am a woman without limits.

459
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,072
I am a woman without limits.
Hmm?

460
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,033
Something else bothering you?

461
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:13,329
It's an impossible pairing,
Windermerians and Earthlings.

462
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,331
How can you be so certain?

463
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,709
My family was killed by Earthlings.

464
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,466
Our village has known war as
well. And there's the fact that

465
00:31:25,591 --> 00:31:28,427
our life span is different
than that of Earthlings.

466
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,889
To tell the truth, the
villagers are all worried

467
00:31:32,264 --> 00:31:37,770
that one day this will bring
sorrow to you folks and Freyja.

468
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:44,652
Even so, one day all winds will be as one.

469
00:31:54,286 --> 00:31:55,496
Found it!

470
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,292
I'm home.

471
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:01,919
So this is your tree, Freyja?

472
00:32:02,044 --> 00:32:04,839
No, it's my grandma's.

473
00:32:05,214 --> 00:32:07,216
I never met her, but this tree

474
00:32:07,341 --> 00:32:10,761
is the oldest one here,
with the best-tasting apples.

475
00:32:17,601 --> 00:32:18,519
It's so good!

476
00:32:18,644 --> 00:32:19,979
Right?

477
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:24,483
And then the smaller trees
around you are the ones I planted.

478
00:32:24,608 --> 00:32:25,401
Oh.

479
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:28,279
The one atop that hill is my mom's,

480
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,656
and the one back there is my dad's.

481
00:32:31,615 --> 00:32:34,326
My mom became one with the wind

482
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:38,497
when I was three, and my dad
just after the last war.

483
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,374
I see.

484
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:44,086
I think I was about ten
when my old man died.

485
00:32:44,211 --> 00:32:45,921
You said he was a pilot.

486
00:32:46,046 --> 00:32:49,300
I told you about Commander Arad too, right?

487
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:51,719
Yes, he was your father's subordinate.

488
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:52,845
That's right.

489
00:32:53,387 --> 00:32:57,975
He recruited me to be a pilot when I
didn't know what to do with myself.

490
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:03,939
I still remember it vividly,
my first solo flight.

491
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,485
I felt it right then...

492
00:33:11,405 --> 00:33:13,866
The feeling that I was with my dad.

493
00:33:15,075 --> 00:33:16,994
He was kind of an eccentric guy.

494
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:20,289
Always sending hand written letters
from where he was stationed,

495
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:23,042
each with a single random phrase.

496
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,126
Like what?

497
00:33:24,251 --> 00:33:26,128
Like this.

498
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,589
"The sky is vast."

499
00:33:30,716 --> 00:33:31,717
The sky is...

500
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,890
The sky is vast!

501
00:33:39,266 --> 00:33:41,143
"Scent of the rain."

502
00:33:41,268 --> 00:33:43,062
"Stars fill the night."

503
00:33:49,276 --> 00:33:52,446
<i>A fruit still green is one</i>

504
00:33:52,571 --> 00:33:55,783
<i>Being attracted is two</i>

505
00:33:55,908 --> 00:34:00,538
<i>My heart is burning</i>

506
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,373
Freyia"

507
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:05,668
<i>A promise is three</i>

508
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:09,046
<i>Being plucked is four</i>

509
00:34:09,171 --> 00:34:13,467
<i>Traveling the sky's end</i>

510
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:18,514
<i>The stars must be sad too</i>

511
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,474
The stars must <i>be sad</i> too
"Clouds shaped like mountains."

512
00:34:20,474 --> 00:34:20,975
<i>The stars must be sad too</i>

513
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:21,809
<i>Five, tears well up and fall</i>

<i>of those we love</i>

528
00:35:23,203 --> 00:35:26,915
That was a Windermerian song of legend,
passed down for generations.

529
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:32,421
It's about a village girl and the God of
the Wind who came from across the stars.

530
00:35:32,546 --> 00:35:35,132
A bittersweet love song.

531

I love you, Freyia!

532
00:35:42,973 --> 00:35:44,767
I want to live our lives out together!

533

Did you know that apple blossoms
only bloom for ten days?

534
00:35:58,864 --> 00:36:02,326
They burst into bloom,
and fall right away.

535
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,287
Are you really okay with that?

536
00:36:05,704 --> 00:36:07,581
With an apple flower like me?

537
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,959
I love you Freyja, however you are!

538
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,340

No, but I can't feel my legs...

The attack was so sudden, my men...

932
00:48:24,734 --> 00:48:28,863
Don't give up hope, they
might just be in another room.

933
00:48:28,988 --> 00:48:30,907
Get me the data on treating Windermerians!

00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:42,127
Can you brief us on the current situation...

938
00:48:45,713 --> 00:48:48,716

00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:49,634
Hmm?

940
00:48:49,759 --> 00:48:51,678
Staff Officer Exedol Folmo...

941
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,930
It's been a while, Mirage.

942
00:48:54,055 --> 00:48:56,099
If you're here, that means...

943
00:48:56,224 --> 00:49:00,603
I see you're still leaving your
blind spot wide open, Lt. Mirage.

944
00:49:00,728 --> 00:49:01,521
That's...

945
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:09,696
I'm Maximilian Jenius, captain
of the Macross Gigasion.

946
00:49:10,196 --> 00:49:12,407
I thought it must be you, grandfather.

947
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:13,741
Grandfather?

948
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:16,327
The <i>legendary</i> genius ace pilot.

949
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:19,581
And captain of Battle 7 of the Macross 7 Fleet.

950
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:21,416
Whoa!

951
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:25,044
I heard you retired from the military,
Grandfather. What are you doing here?

952
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,505
I was recruited by Xaos.

953
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:31,342
Rescue orders came from Lady M.

954
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,303
Aren't communications with HQ still out?

955
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:37,015
The order was transmitted
directly to my brain.

956
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:41,644
Lady M's Fold comms officer

957
00:49:41,769 --> 00:49:45,773
and I are of the same DNA, so...

958
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:48,234
Ragna has also fallen to the enemy.

959
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,197
Captain, med bay is reporting that

960
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:55,533
the Windermerian taken
aboard is in critical condition...

961
00:49:56,117 --> 00:49:57,577
Father Johann!

962
00:49:57,702 --> 00:50:01,581
Apparently he wishes to speak
with Lt. Hayate lmmelmann.

963
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:03,791
Me?

964
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:10,215
You are Wright's...

965
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:14,177
Wright |mme|mann's boy, yes?

966
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:19,140
Your wind is connected
to his, I can feel it.

967
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:24,479
A wind full of love for freedom
and for the world.

968
00:50:25,438 --> 00:50:27,148
How do you know about my dad?

969
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:33,238
Your pendant. I was the one
who sent it to your mother.

970
00:50:33,738 --> 00:50:35,740
You? But why?

971
00:50:36,157 --> 00:50:39,619
Well, your father was
stationed on Windermere.

972
00:50:39,744 --> 00:50:40,578
Huh...?

973
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:44,415
Major Wright lmmelmann
was a special operative,

974
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:48,545
his mission was to investigate
temples and Protoculture ruins.

975
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:51,506
A special operative? My dad?

976
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,299
Worry not.

977
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:58,137
He never did anything to harm our people.

978
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:03,726
<i>During his mission, something was
taken from a Windermerian temple.</i>

979
00:51:04,143 --> 00:51:06,479
It was a relic of the Protoculture...

980
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:09,107
Cell samples of
the Singers of the Stars.

981
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,319
That must be Mikumo's...

982
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:17,282
<i>The culprit who took them
was a U.N. Government diplomat.</i>

983
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,784
<i>He was really an operative as well.</i>

984
00:51:20,618 --> 00:51:25,873
Wright asked me to help
retrieve the samples...

985
00:51:28,042 --> 00:51:30,920
We were able to recover only one of them.

986
00:51:31,462 --> 00:51:34,549
Then relations between Windermere
and the U.N. Government soured,

987
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:37,093
making it impossible to return the sample.

988
00:51:37,218 --> 00:51:39,178
Enter Lady M...

989
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:43,141
I never imagined Major Wright was
involved with the Singer of the Stars.

990
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:47,478
He went after the other sample,
and it cost him his life...

991
00:51:49,188 --> 00:51:55,028
Your father fought for
Windermere to the very end—

992
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:57,447
Father Johann!

993
00:51:57,822 --> 00:51:59,991
There is no need to be sad,

994
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:04,203
lam only fulfilling my duty.

995
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:09,083
Wright used to say that
all winds will be as one.

996
00:52:10,084 --> 00:52:13,046
We failed to prevent the war,

997
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:14,922
but someday...

998
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:16,674
Freyja.

999
00:52:16,799 --> 00:52:18,509
|-|'m here!

1000
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:25,016
A rune that shines too bright
can shorten one's life.

1001
00:52:26,225 --> 00:52:28,603
You must reflect on this well.

1002
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:35,693
For what do you live?
For what do you sing...

1003
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,370
Father Johann...

1004
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:53,336
Go with the Wind,
to the Fountain of Wind...

1005
00:53:00,134 --> 00:53:01,260
Hayate?

1006
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:04,472
A Windermerian becoming one with the wind

1007
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:08,685
is when our time ends.
So you've never seen it before...

1008
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:26,369
<i>The agent who stole the samples</i>

1009
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:29,914
<i>is currently working for Epsilon.</i>

1010
00:53:30,039 --> 00:53:33,668
The Epsilon Foundation, a conglomerate
with thousands of companies to its name.

1011
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:36,045
I've heard plenty of
shady rumors about them.

1012
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,922
<i>Sidney Hunt.</i>

1013
00:53:38,047 --> 00:53:41,843
<i>lt seems he bought himself a fine
position at Epsilon with the sample.</i>

1014
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,011
He's the guy behind my dad's...

1015
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:47,056
This man who stole the
other Singer of the Stars‘...

1016
00:53:47,181 --> 00:53:49,308
That voice we heard
sounded like Mikumo's, but...

1017
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:51,978
There was no soul in it.

1018
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:54,981
It was empty and pitch
black like darkness itself.

1019
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:55,982
A Yamikumo.

1020
00:53:56,107 --> 00:53:58,276
Maybe it's not fully-formed.

1021
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:01,904
They might have only made brain
cells and other necessary organs.

1022
00:54:02,363 --> 00:54:04,365
But what about that singer we sensed?

1023
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:06,075
A virturoid...

1024
00:54:06,951 --> 00:54:10,246
<i>Bio-Fold Waves have the power
to convey music and emotions</i>

1025
00:54:10,371 --> 00:54:14,667
<i>through space and time by
resonating with Fold Quartz.</i>

1026
00:54:15,084 --> 00:54:17,128
<i>It's very possible that they're using</i>

1027
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:20,298
<i>the Singer of the Stars‘ power
to boost the energy of their</i>

1028
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:23,509
<i>Reaction Engines and Fold weapons.</i>

1029
00:54:23,926 --> 00:54:25,970
You mean they're using music as a weapon?

1030
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:30,433
<i>A video message from Windermere
is being broadcast on the Galaxy Network.</i>

1031
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,143
From Windermere?

1032
00:54:32,268 --> 00:54:34,103
- <i>Put it up on the monitor.
-Aye sir.</i>

1033
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:38,900
What's this?

1034
00:54:39,525 --> 00:54:42,153
<i>Since ancient times, humanity has made war</i>

1035
00:54:42,278 --> 00:54:46,032
<i>throughout history, causing much
death and destruction along the way.</i>

1036
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:48,868
<i>We are Heimdall,</i>

1037
00:54:48,993 --> 00:54:52,538
<i>and we are here to liberate
humanity from its rusted chains.</i>

1038
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:54,290
Liberate?

1039
00:54:54,415 --> 00:54:59,420
<i>Our objective is to rid the galaxy of
the U.N. Government, N.U.N.S., PMCs,</i>

1040
00:54:59,545 --> 00:55:04,300
<i>and the one secretly pulling
all their strings, Lady M.</i>

1041
00:55:05,092 --> 00:55:10,556
<i>Lady M is a shadowy figure that has been
manipulating the U.N. Government behind</i>

1042
00:55:10,681 --> 00:55:15,728
<i>the scenes, banning the use of advanced
technology and ruling humanity in secret.</i>

1043
00:55:15,853 --> 00:55:17,563
Sharon Apple?!

1044
00:55:17,688 --> 00:55:18,481
No way!

1045
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:24,237
<i>The ban on A.I. and cloning research, the
restrictions on Protoculture technology,</i>

1046
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:27,365
<i>all implemented to enforce their
monopoly over advanced technology.</i>

1047
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:32,370
<i>Many tragedies could‘ve been averted if
these had been available to the public,</i>

1048
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:35,915
<i>the Windermerian revolt being one of them.</i>

1049
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:39,794
<i>It was Lady M who used cell samples
left behind by the Protoculture</i>

1050
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:44,757
<i>to create the Super Dimensional
Sound Weapon Mikumo Guynemer,</i>

1051
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:48,845
<i>utilizing cloning technology that
was supposed to be banned.</i>

1052
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:50,513
This man...

1053
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:54,183
<i>We cannot tolerate this
oppression any longer.</i>

1054
00:55:54,308 --> 00:55:59,564
<i>We shall overthrow these tyrants
and usher the galaxy into a new age!</i>

1055
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:04,443
<i>Video analysis complete.</i>

1056
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,404
<i>Ian Cromwell,</i>

1057
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:11,993
<i>former captain of the Macross
Astrea in N.U.N.S.‘ Seventh Fleet.</i>

1058
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:16,289
<i>He went MIA along with
his ship eight years ago.</i>

1059
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,792
So, "Iron" Cromwell is still alive.

1060
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:23,713
He was the hero of the
Battle of Zalg-gantz,

1061
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:25,006
where he subdued

1062
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:28,634
an entire rogue Zentradi
fleet with just one ship.

1063
00:56:28,759 --> 00:56:30,386
Why would a hero do this?

1064
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:33,431
That looks like

1065
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:36,976
an advanced model of the illegal
Sharon Apple type quantum A.l. system.

1066
00:56:37,768 --> 00:56:39,937
But instead of a bio-neural
chip, they must've

1067
00:56:40,062 --> 00:56:42,565
used the Singer of the Stars‘ cells.

1068
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:45,484
So that's why they took
Windermere and Ragna,

1069
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,446
they want to use the Protoculture
ruins as amplifiers...

1070
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:53,534
If they seize all the ruins in the
Globular Cluster, the galaxy would...

1071
00:56:53,951 --> 00:56:55,870
By the order of Lady M,

1072
00:56:55,995 --> 00:57:00,166
we are to stop the enemy's plan and
recover the Singer of the Stars‘ cells.

1073
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:09,842
I wasn't able to handle
the enemy's agility at all.

1074
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:12,511
Will they fly?

1075
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:15,431
Don't worry, we'll patch them up real nice

1076
00:57:15,556 --> 00:57:17,016
with spare Kairos parts.

1077
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,684
I analyzed the enemy's

1078
00:57:18,809 --> 00:57:21,479
Bio-Fold Wave System with
the help of the tech team here,

1079
00:57:21,979 --> 00:57:24,523
so we're adding more Fold Quartz
and updating the amplifiers

1080
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:26,567
on each of your Valkyries.

1081
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:29,528
If they can do it, there's
no reason we can't.

1082
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:34,867
The Fold Quartz should react to our music
and boost the Valkyries‘ performance.

1083
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:39,288
As if we're using our music as a weapon...

1084
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,123
That's not true.

1085
00:57:41,248 --> 00:57:45,836
He's right. Your music gives us strength.

1086
00:57:46,253 --> 00:57:48,172
The strength to protect others.

1087
00:57:49,173 --> 00:57:51,592
Music that protects...

1088
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:56,222
Sweet Mira-Mira! You're such a cutie!

1089
00:57:56,347 --> 00:57:57,932
T-They're pressing against me!

1090
00:57:58,057 --> 00:57:59,308
Not so close!

1091
00:57:59,433 --> 00:58:01,143
- Not so close please!
- You're very sweet too, Haya-Haya.

1092
00:58:01,268 --> 00:58:03,646
Yeah yeah, okay.

1093
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,107
I wonder if Freyja's okay...

1094
00:58:09,193 --> 00:58:12,571
To tell the truth, I was a little shocked
seeing Father Johann die.

1095
00:58:12,697 --> 00:58:15,950
It really drove home the fact
that we're very different races.

1096
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:18,411
Crystallization... Now that I think of it,

1097
00:58:19,161 --> 00:58:20,830
Freyja also showed signs...

1098
00:58:24,583 --> 00:58:27,586
That must've just been a side-effect
of the Protoculture system.

1099
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:30,297
It stopped when the system did...

1100
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:33,676
Yes, I'm probably overthinking things.

1101
00:58:46,772 --> 00:58:48,774
Now even you must realize it.

1102
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:51,610
We're different than the Earthlings.

1103
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,237
That's...

1104
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:56,365
Our place is within that Wind.

1105
00:58:56,657 --> 00:58:59,994
I will take back Windermere,
no matter the cost.

1106
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:07,668
<i>It seems that Cromwell
has, on many occasions,</i>

1107
00:59:07,793 --> 00:59:11,839
<i>petitioned the government to
lift the ban on forbidden technology.</i>

1108
00:59:11,964 --> 00:59:15,593
<i>His argument was that the use of unmanned
drones could reduce human casualties,</i>

1109
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:21,390
<i>while cybernetic and cloning technology
could benefit soldiers injured in battle.</i>

1110
00:59:21,515 --> 00:59:26,187
Then, during the Battle of Wagenin, he
recommended using MDE warheads

1111
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:31,275
to halt an invasion by a powerful enemy.
He was ignored.

1112
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,862
As a result, his fleet and his
home planet were wiped out.

1113
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:38,157
A man like him, having survived
something like that...

1114
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:41,160
He's got nothing left to lose.

1115
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:45,414
<i>There's nothing so dangerous
as a wounded beast.</i>

1116
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,250
What about this Heimdall group?

1117
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:54,215
I've heard of it before. People displeased
with Lady M, who operate in secret.

1118
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:58,511
N.U.N.S. still hasn't decided
what to do about them yet.

1119
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:00,513
<i>Approaching destination.</i>

1120
01:00:01,013 --> 01:00:03,182
<i>Our makeshift base of operations.</i>

1121
01:00:03,307 --> 01:00:07,436
I see. A decommissioned
Zentradi factory satellite...

1122
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:21,617
N.U.N.S. rescue craft?

1123
01:00:21,742 --> 01:00:26,288
Survivors from a fleet that ran
into those new enemy fighters.

1124
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:41,929
Lt. Bogue Con-Vaart here. I'm doing
you a favor and joining Delta Flight.

1125
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:45,015
I'll have you know that I don't
do this kind of service often.

1126
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:46,976
This for real sir?

1127
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:47,935
It's for real.

1128
01:00:48,435 --> 01:00:50,396
Now, let's get started.

1129
01:00:51,313 --> 01:00:54,066
1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1130
01:00:54,191 --> 01:00:56,902
1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1131
01:00:57,027 --> 01:00:59,780
1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1132
01:00:59,905 --> 01:01:02,658
1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1133
01:01:02,783 --> 01:01:05,953
1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

1134
01:01:07,121 --> 01:01:08,831
<i>Quit joking around</i>

1135
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:10,207
<i>-Stop it
-Seriously</i>

1136
01:01:10,332 --> 01:01:11,625
<i>-N0 more
-Get lost</i>

1137
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:14,378
<i>Don't treat me like I'm stupid</i>

1138
01:01:14,503 --> 01:01:15,880
<i>Wow</i>

1139
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,716
<i>You're one to talk</i>

1140
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,594
<i>Thar son of a bitch, you son of a bitch</i>

1141
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:24,555
<i>Just go away already</i>

1142
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:25,848
<i>You dream-stealing rogue</i>

1143
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:27,725
<i>Wow</i>

1144
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:33,147
<i>Hey Miss, those guys are
wolves in sheep's clothing</i>

1145
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:39,236
<i>They're lying in wait, their sights
locked on. Then they swoop in on you</i>

1146
01:01:39,361 --> 01:01:39,987
<i>These deluded fools have no shame</i>

1147
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:41,822
<i>These deluded fools have no shame
Enemy combat data uploaded

1148
01:01:41,822 --> 01:01:41,947
<i>These deluded fools have no shame</i>

1149
01:01:41,947 --> 01:01:44,116
<i>These deluded fools have no shame
Reducing limiter by 60%.</i>

1150
01:01:44,116 --> 01:01:44,909
<i>These deluded fools have no shame</i>

1151
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:48,954
<i>They don't even understand heartache</i>

1152
01:01:48,954 --> 01:01:49,955
<i>They don't even understand heartache
Slippery sunofa...!</i>

1153
01:01:49,955 --> 01:01:50,080
<i>Slippery sunofa...!</i>

1154
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:50,789
<i>Your type of girl? (you fool)
Slippery sunofa...!</i>

1155
01:01:50,789 --> 01:01:54,168
<i>Your type of girl? (you fool)</i>

1156
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:55,211
<i>Your type of girl? (you fool)

Man, we got beat.

1258
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:50,844
You fly like a pesky insect.

1259
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,221
What's that?

1260
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:56,183
I'm on a mission to liberate Windermere,

1261
01:04:56,308 --> 01:04:58,018
so don't get in my way again!

1262
01:04:58,143 --> 01:04:59,186
So am I!

1263
01:04:59,311 --> 01:05:02,147
For your girl?
This isn't a game.

1264
01:05:02,272 --> 01:05:03,023
What did you say?

1265
01:05:03,148 --> 01:05:05,150
Whoa. C'mon man, don't.

1266
01:05:05,275 --> 01:05:07,611
Chuck's family's on Ragna...

1267
01:05:07,986 --> 01:05:10,697
and Freyja's village is on Windermere!

1268
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:14,159
What do you care? You're from Earth.

1269
01:05:14,284 --> 01:05:16,912
They're an important part of my life now!

1270
01:05:17,037 --> 01:05:19,373
So I'm going to take back
Ragna and Windermere!

1271
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:20,582
You're all talk!

1272
01:05:20,707 --> 01:05:24,837
What do you plan on doing after you
get them back?! You damn invaders!

1273
01:05:29,174 --> 01:05:30,217
Stop this at once!

1274
01:05:31,885 --> 01:05:32,970
Lt. Bogue.

1275
01:05:34,221 --> 01:05:38,517
Unlike the Sv-262, the roll rate
of the VF-31 increases as you go.

1276
01:05:38,642 --> 01:05:40,519
Practice and get used to that ASAP.

1277
01:05:42,062 --> 01:05:42,980
I know.

1278
01:05:43,605 --> 01:05:44,440
Hayate lmmelmann.

1279
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:48,944
I know how you're feeling,
but you need to have patience.

1280
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:59,079
You two. I wish you had shown
that much spirit on the battlefield.

1281
01:06:04,418 --> 01:06:05,586
Grandfather!

1282
01:06:07,754 --> 01:06:10,424
Grandpa... Captain are you alright?

1283
01:06:10,883 --> 01:06:13,886
You're too kind-hearted
to be a good fighter.

1284
01:06:14,803 --> 01:06:17,681
You lack the resolve to go for the kill

1285
01:06:17,806 --> 01:06:19,308
with total disregard for others.

1286
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:23,103
You've probably even disengaged
from a romantic rivalry, for all I know.

1287
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:25,564
T-That's. . .!

1288
01:06:26,940 --> 01:06:28,066
I...

1289
01:06:29,943 --> 01:06:33,864
I don't have your genius, captain.

1290
01:06:35,949 --> 01:06:39,286
Yes, you do lack the
talent to be an ace.

1291
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:54,384
Freyja!

1292
01:06:56,261 --> 01:06:57,429
Hayate?

1293
01:06:57,554 --> 01:06:58,263
Here.

1294
01:06:59,806 --> 01:07:02,893
That's... Grandma's apple!

1295
01:07:03,018 --> 01:07:06,104
Sorry it took me so long to get it to you.

1296
01:07:07,689 --> 01:07:10,943
Thank you Hayate, thank you!

1297
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:14,154
It's pretty bruised up, but
there are seeds inside.

1298
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:18,575
I promise I'll take back Windermere,

1299
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:24,289
then we'll replant the orchard
with these seeds together, okay?

1300
01:07:25,332 --> 01:07:28,877
Even if it takes us years...
No, decades.

1301
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:33,549
Okay, Frevia’?

1302
01:07:35,342 --> 01:07:38,011
Y-Yes... Sure.

1303
01:07:39,304 --> 01:07:40,556
Thank you.

1304
01:07:41,765 --> 01:07:42,516
Freyja?

1305
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:45,060
Ah, I have to go.

1306
01:07:45,185 --> 01:07:47,688
Huh? Hey, Frevia’?

1307
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:00,742
You must forgive Hayate.

1308
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:05,455
He's an idiot, but he means well.

1309
01:08:06,206 --> 01:08:08,292
Yeah, I know.

1310
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:12,588
But that's the kind of guy
you fell in love with, right?

1311
01:08:14,631 --> 01:08:18,176
Yes but... I see now that I'm different,

1312
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:20,804
than you and Hayate.

1313
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:24,766
So you think Hayate won't
be happy if he's with you?

1314
01:08:31,481 --> 01:08:33,358
You can't just decide things on your own!

1315
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:37,237
Both of you have to
think this through together!

1316
01:08:42,451 --> 01:08:43,535
Alright)!-

1317
01:08:47,706 --> 01:08:49,541
I was in love with Hayate too.

1318
01:08:49,666 --> 01:08:50,584
Huh?

1319
01:08:50,709 --> 01:08:54,963
But I think my feelings for him were
a little bit different than yours.

1320
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:58,300
I guess I admired him.

1321
01:08:58,925 --> 01:09:01,803
I wanted to be a free spirit like him.

1322
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,807
I'm rooting for you both.

1323
01:09:06,224 --> 01:09:07,434
Mirage...

1324
01:09:07,934 --> 01:09:11,438
And inter-planetary marriages are
no longer a rare thing these days.

1325
01:09:11,563 --> 01:09:13,982
Oh right, Makina told me.

1326
01:09:14,107 --> 01:09:17,402
Captain Max was the first one to do it!

1327
01:09:17,527 --> 01:09:21,448
M-My grandparents are not
a good example!

1328
01:09:21,573 --> 01:09:25,494
Voted No.1 famous couple
most likely to split by the tabloids

1329
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:27,329
for 50 years in a row.

1330
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:29,081
To be fair, the articles said

1331
01:09:29,206 --> 01:09:32,250
their problem was more their
personalities than anything else.

1332
01:09:32,584 --> 01:09:34,961
Talking romance? We
wanna be in the mix too!

1333
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:38,382
Mixing and churning. Caution, do not mix.

1334
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:40,884
Come on, not again!

1335
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:44,429
I thought I understood

1336
01:09:45,555 --> 01:09:47,891
how different our races were, but...

1337
01:09:50,227 --> 01:09:52,562
But that doesn't change how
you feel about her right?

1338
01:09:52,688 --> 01:09:57,109
No but... I got to thinking,

1339
01:09:57,651 --> 01:10:01,071
would she really be
happy being with me?

1340
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:12,290
You two need to talk this through.

1341
01:10:15,168 --> 01:10:18,714
If you wait until it's
too late, you'll regret it.

1342
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:21,133
Kaname...

1343
01:10:21,258 --> 01:10:22,926
If you half-ass this thing,

1344
01:10:23,051 --> 01:10:25,804
you'll have all of WalkUre
to deal with. Got it?

1345
01:10:26,972 --> 01:10:27,764
Yes ma'am.

1346
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:32,686
I never wanted to be
ship's captain you know.

1347
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:36,732
At the time, N.U.N.S.
was short on officers,

1348
01:10:36,857 --> 01:10:38,900
so I had no choice but to accept.

1349
01:10:39,776 --> 01:10:44,364
But even now, I still feel I was
born to be a pilot and nothing else.

1350
01:10:45,198 --> 01:10:48,577
I'm afraid the same can't
be said for Mirage though.

1351
01:10:48,702 --> 01:10:51,538
Yes, she's not really ace pilot material.

1352
01:10:57,794 --> 01:10:59,045
Knockout gas?

1353
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:01,006
What are you doing there!

1354
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:10,390
Get down!

1355
01:11:35,165 --> 01:11:36,124
<i>Mach!</i>

1356
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:57,229
Commander Arad, are you alright?

1357
01:11:58,063 --> 01:12:01,191
Our location's been compromised...

1358
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:03,860
I'm afraid it's worse than that.

1359
01:12:08,198 --> 01:12:11,618
My apologies. I was away
from my station when...

1360
01:12:11,743 --> 01:12:13,495
No, it's alright.

1361
01:12:14,246 --> 01:12:16,581
I'm leaving the team in
your charge, Mirage.

1362
01:12:16,706 --> 01:12:17,707
<i>Rogen.</i>

1363
01:12:18,583 --> 01:12:19,626
A musical score?

1364
01:12:19,751 --> 01:12:22,170
<i>It's a directive from Lady M.</i>

1365
01:12:22,295 --> 01:12:24,631
Encoded for Xaos‘ eyes only?

1366
01:12:25,131 --> 01:12:27,092
That thing hacked the message, so...

1367
01:12:27,592 --> 01:12:29,678
By analyzing the encrypted data,

1368
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:35,308
our enemy must've figured that they
can pinpoint Lady M's location.

1369
01:12:35,934 --> 01:12:37,227
Captain Max,

1370
01:12:37,602 --> 01:12:40,564
I assume you know Lady M's true identity?

1371
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:43,775
Their official codename is
Lady Megaroad-O1.

1372
01:12:44,276 --> 01:12:46,570
<i>Megaroad-01... You mean...?</i>

1373
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:52,742
The flagship of the First Emigration
Fleet that left Earth in 2012.

1374
01:12:53,451 --> 01:12:57,706
Comms were lost in 2016, and
they've been missing ever since...

1375
01:12:58,081 --> 01:13:00,917
Then one of our affiliate organizations

1376
01:13:01,042 --> 01:13:03,795
picked up a Fold Wave transmission
coming from subspace

1377
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:07,048
using the same frequency
as the Megaroad-O1.

1378
01:13:07,465 --> 01:13:08,842
After analyzing the transmission,

1379
01:13:08,967 --> 01:13:11,845
we found that it contained the
protocol codes needed to

1380
01:13:11,970 --> 01:13:15,932
unlock the mystery of the Star Song
and the Protoculture ruins.

1381
01:13:16,057 --> 01:13:19,686
<i>Then Lady M is someone
aboard the Megar0ad-07 7</i>

1382
01:13:20,103 --> 01:13:21,396
We don't know.

1383
01:13:21,521 --> 01:13:25,734
We're unsure if we can even
call them an intelligent lifeform.

1384
01:13:25,859 --> 01:13:28,653
<i>And you trusted such a thing?</i>

1385
01:13:28,945 --> 01:13:31,114
They're not our enemy, at least.

1386
01:13:31,781 --> 01:13:32,866
For now.

1387
01:13:33,241 --> 01:13:35,035
You don't know that.

1388
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:39,039
If you ask me, this Lady M's
not so different from Cromwell.

1389
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:41,249
<i>The humanoid species of this galaxy</i>

1390
01:13:41,374 --> 01:13:45,170
<i>are still too adolescent to handle
the relics of the Protoculture.</i>

1391
01:13:45,295 --> 01:13:49,841
<i>/t would seem that Lady M watches
over civilization, waiting for it t0 mature.</i>

1392
01:13:49,966 --> 01:13:54,804
<i>So we do not make the same mistakes the
Protoculture made 500,000 years ago.</i>

1393
01:13:55,305 --> 01:13:56,890
Have we alerted them?

1394
01:13:57,015 --> 01:14:00,936
<i>Yes, but the Megaroad-01 is
caught adrift between Fold Faults</i>

1395
01:14:01,061 --> 01:14:02,646
<i>with its systems crippled.</i>

1396
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:04,689
<i>Escape is impossible.</i>

1397
01:14:04,814 --> 01:14:06,232
No...

1398
01:14:08,109 --> 01:14:11,696

Freyja!

1579
01:20:06,634 --> 01:20:08,803
The Macross Gigasion has
executed an emergency Fold.

1580
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:12,598
Hmm, seems there's an
issue with the Siren System?

1581
01:20:12,724 --> 01:20:14,559
It's not a problem.

1582
01:20:14,684 --> 01:20:18,438
We succeeded in generating Bio-Fold
Waves equal to that of all five members

1583
01:20:18,563 --> 01:20:22,233
of Walkiire combined with the
brain cell count of a single person.

1584
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:24,694
And look,

1585
01:20:25,486 --> 01:20:29,073
we've seized all the planets
that have Protoculture ruins.

1586
01:20:29,449 --> 01:20:30,616
Now we can open

1587
01:20:30,742 --> 01:20:34,120
Super Fold Gates anywhere in the galaxy.

1588
01:20:34,245 --> 01:20:37,832
Funding Roid Brehm's research
has paid off very well indeed.

1589
01:20:38,249 --> 01:20:42,754
First you aided the Windermerians,
now you're helping us...

1590
01:20:42,879 --> 01:20:44,505
How clever.

1591
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:47,508
Well, you're both our
valued customers.

1592
01:20:51,137 --> 01:20:52,555
Enhanced sensory awareness?

1593
01:20:52,972 --> 01:20:54,766
Sensing Hayate was in danger,

1594
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:58,227
Freyja's Bio-Fold Waves
intensified to the max.

1595
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:02,440
This caused his Fold Quartz to
resonate with Fre-Fre's singing,

1596
01:21:02,565 --> 01:21:05,193
enhancing Haya-Haya's senses and abilities.

1597
01:21:05,485 --> 01:21:08,237
So it made him go berserk...

1598
01:21:08,821 --> 01:21:11,449
It's my fault... she's like this.

1599
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:18,373
Singing... is... my...

1600
01:21:18,706 --> 01:21:21,626
Freyja, I'm taking you off the mission.

1601
01:21:22,126 --> 01:21:23,544
No...

1602
01:21:23,669 --> 01:21:26,923
Someone who can't even
stand on their own

1603
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:28,716
will be a hindrance on the battlefield.

1604
01:21:31,344 --> 01:21:32,970
So you just rest for now.

1605
01:21:33,513 --> 01:21:36,057
Relax, we'll take back
Windermere and Ragna.

1606
01:21:36,432 --> 01:21:38,518
Then we'll have a party
with jellyfish and apples.

1607
01:21:38,643 --> 01:21:39,727
Chuck...

1608
01:21:40,311 --> 01:21:41,813
Here, Fre-Fre...

1609
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:44,565
It's a seed from the apple
that Haya-Haya saved.

1610
01:21:44,690 --> 01:21:46,734
You should bring it back to Windermere.

1611
01:21:50,196 --> 01:21:51,406
Alright)!-

1612
01:21:53,032 --> 01:21:55,451
Freyja can't sing anymore?

1613
01:21:56,828 --> 01:21:58,454
What do you mean by that?!

1614
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,915
You saw how weak she's become...

1615
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:04,210
It's unlikely she can take the strain
of enhanced Bio-Fold Waves anymore...

1616
01:22:04,335 --> 01:22:06,003
Can't she be cured?

1617
01:22:06,337 --> 01:22:09,799
Crystallization... isn't a disease.

1618
01:22:09,924 --> 01:22:12,218
The damage to her cells is severe.

1619
01:22:12,593 --> 01:22:15,012
Even if she stops, the
damage has been done...

1620
01:22:17,557 --> 01:22:21,644
"A rune that shines too bright
can shorten one's life..."

1621
01:22:22,186 --> 01:22:24,147
So this is what Father Johann meant.

1622
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:27,567
The whitening of the body happened
to His Majesty the King as well.

1623
01:22:27,859 --> 01:22:30,945
So, if she doesn't sing,
it won't get worse?

1624
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:34,949
I don't know. But she
can't sing on battlefield...

1625
01:22:35,783 --> 01:22:40,204
Walkijlre will do the mission with just
four of you then. It won't be easy...

1626
01:22:40,329 --> 01:22:41,664
We'll get the job done.

1627
01:22:41,789 --> 01:22:43,833
If we can somehow jam
the enemy's singing...

1628
01:22:43,958 --> 01:22:45,668
Let's get started right away.

1629
01:22:46,002 --> 01:22:46,878
Okay.

1630
01:23:06,272 --> 01:23:07,773
Mikumo?

1631
01:23:22,497 --> 01:23:24,874
I... want to sing...!

1632
01:23:26,709 --> 01:23:29,545
with Freyja... With you again, Freyja...

1633
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:31,881
Mikumo...

1634
01:23:37,136 --> 01:23:41,557
When things got rough during the war,
music helped get me through it.

1635
01:23:42,433 --> 01:23:48,064
That's why I always looked up to WalkiJre.
You protect people with music.

1636
01:23:50,024 --> 01:23:54,987
Don't worry. No matter what happens, I'll...

1637
01:23:55,571 --> 01:23:57,323
always be a Walkilre, okay?

1638
01:23:59,408 --> 01:24:00,743
Freyia"

1639
01:24:11,128 --> 01:24:13,464
<i>It's been too long,
Commander-in-Chief Maximilian.</i>

1640
01:24:13,589 --> 01:24:16,092
<i>We're all excited to
fight beside you again.</i>

1641
01:24:16,425 --> 01:24:18,803
The honor is mine. I'm counting on you.

1642
01:24:18,928 --> 01:24:20,805
Commander Arad, what's our plan?

1643
01:24:21,305 --> 01:24:23,558
The next time the enemy
opens their Fold gates,

1644
01:24:23,683 --> 01:24:26,978
we'll go through one of them
and attack Windermere.

1645
01:24:27,103 --> 01:24:28,187
ls that possible?

1646
01:24:28,312 --> 01:24:32,275
We've devised a strike plan based
on Commander Arad's proposal.

1647
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:34,735
We believe it to be possible if we

1648
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:38,489
boost the Fold drives of our ships
with Wa|kiJre's Bio-Fold Waves.

1649
01:24:38,906 --> 01:24:42,159
We believe the gates can be opened on
any planet with Protoculture ruins.

1650
01:24:42,285 --> 01:24:44,912
The nearest one to our
current position is...

1651
01:24:45,037 --> 01:24:46,789
Planet Alfheim.

1652
01:24:47,748 --> 01:24:51,752
We should be able to sneak in undetected
by using the asteroid belt as cover.

1653
01:24:52,962 --> 01:24:54,880
ls there something wrong, Miss Kaname?

1654
01:24:55,006 --> 01:24:55,756
No sir.

1655
01:24:55,881 --> 01:24:59,969
A fallen comrade used to be stationed on
that planet when he served in N.U.N.S.

1656
01:25:00,636 --> 01:25:02,972

Me? Flight commander?

1660
01:25:23,075 --> 01:25:25,995
I can't. We need you to
lead us, Commander Arad!

1661
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,039
There's only so much I
can do from the bridge.

1662
01:25:28,914 --> 01:25:31,584
It'll be okay. You can do it.

1663
01:25:32,043 --> 01:25:34,795
Just be yourself. Fly in your own sky.

1664
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:38,466

Sir.

1667
01:25:47,266 --> 01:25:50,311
Sorry for not telling you
about your father.

1668
01:25:50,728 --> 01:25:53,773
It's alright. But I never would've
guessed he was on Windermere.

1669
01:25:54,148 --> 01:25:56,525
I'll tell you more about him some other time.

1670
01:25:56,651 --> 01:25:58,486
The kid-friendly stories, at least.

1671
01:25:58,861 --> 01:26:00,279
Yes, please do.

1672
01:26:00,404 --> 01:26:02,365
Well, don't you have
somewhere to be?

1673
01:26:02,490 --> 01:26:03,115
Huh?

1674
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:05,159
Not much time left before the operation.

1675
01:26:05,284 --> 01:26:07,662
Yes... Thank you sir.

Gotta hurry...

1679
01:26:30,184 --> 01:26:33,521
Don't be a fool! You're gonna
try to sing?! In your condition?

1680
01:26:33,646 --> 01:26:35,147
I'm supposed to be a WaIkUre!

1681
01:26:36,273 --> 01:26:38,192
I'm supposed to be a WaIkUre, but...

1682
01:26:40,277 --> 01:26:43,197
I said, "no matter what happens," but...

1683
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:47,159
Why am I... I'm scared...

1684
01:26:48,869 --> 01:26:50,871
I'm afraid to sing.

1685
01:26:51,497 --> 01:26:52,915
I'm scared of dying!

A Wa|kUre's supposed to protect everyone by singing.

1687
01:27:03,342 --> 01:27:05,970
But I can't... I can't sing.

1688
01:27:06,470 --> 01:27:07,555

1691
01:27:14,103 --> 01:27:15,354
What should I do?

1692
01:27:15,896 --> 01:27:19,275
What should I do, Hayate?

1693
01:27:23,612 --> 01:27:25,030
You have to stop singing.

1694
01:27:26,615 --> 01:27:30,828
Then I'll no longer be a WalkUre.

1695
01:27:30,953 --> 01:27:34,081
Can you live without flying, Hayate?

1696
01:27:35,082 --> 01:27:37,585
I'll protect Windermere! I promise.

1697
01:27:38,711 --> 01:27:40,504
So I want you to live.

1698
01:27:41,213 --> 01:27:43,090
I want you to live on!

1699
01:27:43,924 --> 01:27:47,261
I want to live my life with you.

1700
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:49,805
So do I...

1701
01:27:50,723 --> 01:27:53,601
I want to be with you too, Hayate.

1702
01:27:54,059 --> 01:27:54,935
But...

1703
01:27:55,352 --> 01:27:56,604

01:32:39,511 --> 01:32:39,636
Now we will achieve what we
have fought for all this time!

1825
01:32:39,636 --> 01:32:42,765
Let me see you struggle, hear you wail
Now we will achieve what we

01:32:42,765 --> 01:32:44,683
<i>Let me see you struggle, hear you wail</i>

01:32:52,691 --> 01:32:53,734
The innocent <i>smile</i> of hypocrites
Commence Operation Silence!

1832
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:53,859
Commence Operation Silence!

<i>Ah</i>

1838
01:33:12,544 --> 01:33:16,465
So their strategy is to jam all Fold
Waves, even their own songs.

1839
01:33:17,007 --> 01:33:18,884
Fold Jamming successful...

1840
01:33:19,343 --> 01:33:22,221
Remember that WalkUre's singing will
also lose its effect during jamming.

1841
01:33:22,346 --> 01:33:23,555
Let's make this quick!

1842
01:33:27,601 --> 01:33:29,853
Delta 5, don't break formation!

1843
01:33:30,729 --> 01:33:33,023
Delta 3, the bandit at three o'clock...

1844
01:33:33,148 --> 01:33:35,025
No, go with the Thanatos formation!

1845
01:33:37,820 --> 01:33:39,947
Get a grip, Mirage!

1846
01:33:42,741 --> 01:33:45,202
We'll take them out while
the jamming is effective!

1847
01:33:45,327 --> 01:33:48,122
All forces, prepare for
Macross Cannon discharge!

1848
01:33:48,831 --> 01:33:50,874
All ships commencing transformation.

1849
01:33:50,999 --> 01:33:53,210
Connecting power transfer system

1850
01:34:12,604 --> 01:34:13,647
Their singing...

1851
01:34:14,231 --> 01:34:16,525
I can't hear their singing...

1852
01:34:17,651 --> 01:34:20,404
All fighters are to clear the
line of fire immediately.

1853
01:34:20,529 --> 01:34:24,366
<i>I repeat, all fighters are to clear
the Iine of fire immediately.</i>

1854
01:34:29,997 --> 01:34:32,624
<i>Energy charge at 130%.</i>

1855
01:34:33,792 --> 01:34:36,336
All ships, fire your Macross Cannons!

1856
01:35:00,068 --> 01:35:01,653
Their barrier's been reinforced.

1857
01:35:01,778 --> 01:35:02,613
The jamming system's...

1858
01:35:02,738 --> 01:35:04,072
been countered!

1859
01:35:05,324 --> 01:35:09,578
So this is the power of the
Siren System. Magnificent!

1860
01:35:09,703 --> 01:35:11,914
Walkiire is of no further use to us.

1861
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:16,877
Destroy them! Wipe out those
accursed goddesses of Lady M!

Your singing felt pretty good.
As always.

Flowers are white.

2388
01:56:01,912 --> 01:56:03,664
Apples are red.

2389
01:56:04,790 --> 01:56:06,625
They're sour when they're green.

2390
01:56:07,460 --> 01:56:09,336
They're sweet when they're ripe.

2391

01:56:19,305 --> 01:56:22,141
Jellyfish can glow and float in the sky.

2395
01:56:23,726 --> 01:56:25,978
Being alone is lonely.

2396
01:56:26,353 --> 01:56:28,189
Being with everyone feels so...

2397
01:56:28,314 --> 01:56:29,690
- Fun.
- Warm.

2398
01:56:33,235 --> 01:56:35,279
The purple hue of a sunset.

2399
01:56:35,696 --> 01:56:37,865
The chirping of birds.

2400
01:56:38,324 --> 01:56:39,950
The smell of waking up.

2401
01:56:40,534 --> 01:56:42,369
The snowy land.

2402
01:56:48,209 --> 01:56:50,002
The wind is gentle.

2403
01:56:50,794 --> 01:56:52,755
Singing is fun.

2404
01:56:54,131 --> 01:56:55,299
Hayate...

Thank you, Fre-Fre...

We'll always be together, absolutely...

2409
01:57:54,567 --> 01:57:58,904
That's right, we are WaIkUre.
We are five and we are one.

2410
01:57:59,488 --> 01:58:02,741
Let's continue to sing the song of life.

<i>Picking up my broken,</i>

2417
01:58:42,323 --> 01:58:45,242
<i>It makes me</i>

2422
01:59:04,887 --> 01:59:10,684
<i>Even though I want to believe</i>

<i>But this doubt just proves</i>

2427
01:59:34,083 --> 01:59:36,210
<i>that I'm still</i>

2428
